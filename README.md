# Anime Player CLI

**Anime Player CLI** is a simple command-line tool to stream anime directly from your terminal. It fetches stream URLs from the [amvstr.me](https://amvstr.me) API and plays anime episodes using `mpv` media player. 

This tool provides two modes:
1. **Default mode**: Plays the anime episode in your default media player window.
2. **Terminal mode**: Streams anime directly within the terminal using sixel graphics.

---

## Features

- Fetch anime streams from the web.
- Play episodes in your default media player.
- Watch anime directly in your terminal using sixel graphics.

---

## Requirements

- **`mpv` Media Player**: This tool uses `mpv` for streaming.
- **Snap (optional)**: You can install `mpv` using Snap on Ubuntu.

## Installation of `mpv` (Ubuntu)

1. Ensure Snap is installed and up-to-date:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install snapd
